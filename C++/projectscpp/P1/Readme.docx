//This is going to be the first phase of my C++ journey.

//- I'll be starting to make basic codes to dveelop my basic C++ skills.
//- I'll be making a lot of projects to enhance my skills.
//- I'll be doing small assignments to test my skills.
//- The projecs will basically revolve around the basic concepts of C++.
//- The basic concepts include:
//	- Variables
//	- Data types
//	- Operators
//	- Control structures
//	- Functions
//	- Arrays
//	- Pointers
//	- Strings
//	- Structures
//	- Classes
//	- File handling
//	- Exception handling
//	- Templates
//- and after the basics will be clear and I'll be able to make some projects, I'll move on to the advanced concepts of C++.
//- which will help me in phase-2 of my C++ journey.
